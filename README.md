## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🤖 ROS 2 Autonomous Arm Control
**Tech Stack:** ROS 2 Jazzy, Gazebo Harmonic, MoveIt 2, Bullet Physics
> **Description:** Developed a high-fidelity robotic manipulation platform for testing autonomous grasping strategies. The system leverages **ROS 2 Jazzy** and **Gazebo Harmonic** to simulate accurate physics and sensor feedback. [cite_start]It integrates **MoveIt 2** as the motion planner to calculate optimal, collision-free trajectories, effectively translating high-level target goals into precise mechanical execution via the **Bullet Featherstone** physics engine[cite: 51, 52, 54, 55, 56].

### 🔍 Smart Scanner Web App
**Tech Stack:** Node.js, React, Python, YOLOv8, Docker, MongoDB
> **Description:** An AI-powered Visual Search Engine that bridges physical retail products with digital inventory systems. The platform orchestrates a hybrid backend where **Node.js** manages data flow and ephemeral **Python** processes handle visual reasoning. [cite_start]It utilizes **YOLOv8** for real-time object detection and vector similarity algorithms to identify products instantly from camera feeds[cite: 37, 38, 40, 42, 43].

### 📅 WorkSync – AI Team Work Planner
**Tech Stack:** MongoDB, Express, Node.js, Google Gemini AI
> **Description:** An intelligent task delegation platform designed to optimize team workflows. The application analyzes task constraints (deadlines, descriptions) against member profiles (skills, availability) using **Google Gemini AI**. [cite_start]It automatically generates high-efficiency work schedules, effectively deciding "who does what" to maximize team productivity[cite: 21, 23, 24, 25, 26].
